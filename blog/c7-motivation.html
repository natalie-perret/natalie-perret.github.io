              In Search Inside Yourself, Chade-Meng Tan discusses Tony Hsieh's three types of happiness: pleasure, passion and purpose. <strong>Pleasure</strong> is about chasing the next high and is known as the 'rock-star' type of happiness. <strong>Passion</strong> is where peak performance meets peak engagement and time flies by (also known as 'flow'). Finally, <strong>Higher Purpose</strong> is about being part of something bigger than yourself that has meaning to you.               The happiness that arises from pleasure is highly unsustainable. While happiness that arises from passion and higher purpose is highly sustainable.

              My core values are around fairness and justice. So it was no surprise to me that I ended up studying law. I'm passionate about making a positive difference in the world and it's important to me that whatever job I'm doing is making small steps towards this.
