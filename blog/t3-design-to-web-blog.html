              A responsive website automatically adjusts its content depending on the size of the screen of the device on which the user is viewing the content. It is important because there are so many different devices and screen sizes that viewing content made for a desktop computer is very frustrating when viewing on a smartphone screen.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-text">
              The mobile-first design approach stems from the view that mobile design (or design for a smartphone screen) is the hardest, and as such should be done first.

              Frameworks provide a faster and easier way to code. Tasks that would usually take developers hours (or in my case weeks) and hundreds of lines of code to write, can be done in minutes with the pre-built functions that come from using a framework. Other than being faster, another benefit is the support you can get from others using the same framework as you. There are however limitations to how much you can change within the framework so you need to make sure you choose a framework that meets your needs.

              A website wireframe, or blueprint, is a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website. The wireframe depicts the page layout or arrangement of the website’s content, so that the developer can better plan how to go about developing the website.

          <p class="blog-text"> Here are my wireframe images of how I envisioned my website to look like. I had some wins, but some of the design features are in the 'too hard basket' or are 'coming soon'. I still need to work on the resizing of my website for smartphones and ideally have a collapsed menu icon in the top right corner. I also want to learn how to create a drop down menu but baby steps.</p>
