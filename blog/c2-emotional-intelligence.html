      Chapter 1 of Search Inside Yourself: The Unexpected Path to Achieving Success, Happiness (and World Peace) by Chade-Meng Tan was an interesting read. I thought that the results of the study of the top six competencies that distinguish star performers from average performers in the tech sector was really insightful. These included (in this order):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Strong achievement drive and high achievement standards</li>
      <li>Ability to influence</li>
      <li>Conceptual thinking</li>
      <li>Analytical ability</li>
      <li>Initiative in taking on challenges</li>
      <li>Self-confidence</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I think its really important to take some time every day (even just 2 minutes) to be mindful. In saying that, I struggle to do this and find that when I try, I'm distracted by floods of thoughts - what I did today, what I need to do tomorrow, etc. Hopefully practice makes perfect and I'll get there in the end.
