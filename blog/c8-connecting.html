              <strong>Mental Habits for Highly Empathetic People</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="blog-text">
              In Search Inside Yourself, Chade-Meng Tan reminds us that empathy comes preinstalled in our brains but that we can still improve our mental habits that are conducive to empathy. For example, having the mental habit of kindness means that every time you interact with a human being, the thoughts in your minds that arise habitually and effortlessly are, "This person is a human being just like me. I want them to be happy." Chade-Meng states that having this mental habit makes you more receptive to other people, and them more receptive to you.

              Person A: "I met up with a friend today for lunch. I asked her lots of questions about what she has been up to, how her family was, and what she has planned for the rest of the year. By the end of the lunch I knew everything that was going on in her life and she didn't ask me a single question about my life. I felt like she wasn't interested in finding out."

              Person B: "I met up with a friend today for lunch. She bombarded me with a million questions and didn't give me a chance to ask her a single question. By the end of the lunch she knew everything that was going on in my life and I didn't know anything about what was going on in her life. I felt like she was trying to keep things from me."
