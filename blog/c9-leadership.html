              <strong>Compassionate Leadership</strong>

              In Chade-Meng Tan's “Search Inside Yourself", he writes that we will work harder and more effectively for people we like. The Tibetan scholar Thupten Jinpa defines compassion as follows: "Compassion is a mental state endowed with a sense of concern for the suffering of others and aspiration to see that suffering relieved.”

              The book claims that it is possible to train compassion by creating mental habits. One example of this includes 'multiplying goodness meditation'. The traditional practice for developing compassion is something known as Tonglen, which in Tibetan means “giving and receiving.” It is a lot like the Multiplying Goodness practice, except instead of breathing in goodness, you breathe in suffering (of self and others), and transform it within yourself. When you breathe out, you radiate love, kindness, and compassion.

              In Your Brain at Work, David Rock describes five domains of social experience that the brain treats as primary rewards or threats. These five domains include Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness, and Fairness (known as the SCARF model). For me, the domain that resonates the most is "fairness".
