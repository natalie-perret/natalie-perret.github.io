      Responsive webpages are important because back in the day, people viewed website content on their desktop computers. Now, they view it on smartphones, tablets, and laptops which means the webpages needs to respond to the varying screen sizes and adjust content accordingly. Adaptive design allows websites to adjust content for specific devices.
