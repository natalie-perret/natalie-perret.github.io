      Grid based design divides a website into a bunch of rows and columns to better organise content and keep elements aligned and ordered.

      Responsive webpages are important because while people used to view website content on their desktop computers, they now have lots of other options including smartphones, tablets, and laptops. This means that a webpage needs to be able to display its content depending on the screen size. Adaptive design allows a website to adjust its content for specific devices.

      Semantic structure is the use of HTML tags to reinforce the meaning of the information to be displayed. For example if we want to disply text in italics, then we use the tag < em > which indicates <em>'emphasis'</em>.

      'Media queries' changes the webpage display depending on the device being used to view the content. 'Overflow' contains text into a small area and adds a scroll bar. Use 'padding' and 'margins' to add negative space around content.
