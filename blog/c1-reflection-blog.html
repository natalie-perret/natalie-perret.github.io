      I think DBC/EDA is an inspiring grassroots story of how it only takes one or two passionate people to make a difference and I'm stoked to get to experience it first hand. I love the idea that everyone needs to roll up their sleeves and all pitch in, or in other terms "be the change you want to see".

      Moving away from the traditional method of learning - read a book, learn the answers, sit the test - is going to be a challenge for me but I'm looking forward to the experience and have already seen first hand how rewarding trial and error learning can be.
