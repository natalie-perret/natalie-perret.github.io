    <h3>26 February 2017</h3>

    <p>
      I'm good at forming bad habits and then not being able to break them. My goal going forward is to start off my coding experience by creating good habits straight away. I'm notorious for making mountains out of molehills - so for me, what works best is breaking down large, demanding tasks into shorter more manageable steps that don't seem so daunting.

    <p>
      I also excel at spending hours planning and organising how I'm going to do a task - writing up to do lists, mapping the process, filing things into labelled folders with pretty flags all over them (read procrastination) but once I'm in the zone, I'm all go. I plan to experiment with timebox - pomodoro style - because as a perfectionist I will often spend way too long on a task.
