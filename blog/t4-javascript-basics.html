              JavaScript is a programming language that lets web developers design interactive sites. HTML provides the basic structure of a website, and we use CSS to control the style, formatting and layout. JavaScript is used to add the fancy extras to a webpage like an autocomplete search box, and animate elements on the page - like  to show and hide information. It's early days yet for me and JavaScript but initial thoughts are - I don't like it.

              One of the most powerful features of JavaScript is the ability to build intelligence and logic into a webpage. We do this by writing code that makes decisions and repeats tasks until specified criteria are met. For example, if you were writing code to describe someone waking up, you might programme it to say that if that person wakes up at 7am they can go for a run and have a coffee, but if they wake up at 8am they only have time to have a coffee.

              JavaScript provides a data type specifically for storing sequences of values. It is called an array and is written as a list of values between square brackets, separated by commas. Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data, you access the data in objects through properties. This is helpful to store data in a structured way, and can represent real world objects, like a dog or a person.

              In JavaScript, we can divide up our code into reusable parts called functions. A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
