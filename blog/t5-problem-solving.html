              When I was designing this website, I struggled a lot. To the point that I almost quit. Then I started finding solutions. A missing bracket, a misspelt word, a forgotten closing tag, etc. Things were looking up. My website even responded the way it was meant to when I shrunk its size. I was a coding genius. I spent hours redesigning my style now that I had control. Then just before I went to bed, I shrunk the page size and my content didn't respond.

              And just like that, I hit rock bottom again.

              I tried a bunch of different solutions. Each small change, tested in Chrome to see if it had any effect (it didn't). And finally I had to concede that I was no coding genius. I went to bed and my mind raced for hours over everything and anything. And then suddenly, just as I was about to fall asleep, I was suddenly reminded of something I had seen in a YouTube tutorial earlier that week about padding and how when we add padding we have to reduce the percentage of the screen size. And that was it. That was my solution.

              So what did I learn from this? Well, firstly, never give up. There's always a way through, you just need to be patient and resilient despite the feelings of desperation. And secondly, sometimes you need to walk away from the problem before you can solve it.

              Some people say learning JavaScript is like learning a new language. I've learnt a lot of languages, including Chinese (Mandarin) and in my opinion coding is infinitely harder. For me, learning JavaScript is like learning Calculus at high school. It requires memorising a bunch of formulas and then applying these to certain situations.

            <p class="blog-text">
              Some of the functions that are included in a JS Array include: <strong>.map()</strong> which creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in this array; <strong>.filter()</strong> which creates a new array with all of the elements of this array for which the provided filtering function returns true; and <strong>.reduce()</strong> which applies a function against an accumulator and each value of the array (from left-to-right) as to reduce it to a single value.
