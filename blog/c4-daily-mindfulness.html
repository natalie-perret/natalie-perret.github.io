            <p class="blog-text">
              Chade-Meng Tan, in his book Search Inside Yourself claims that "Mindfulness may be one of the most important things you can ever learn in your life." Which is a pretty bold claim. He further describes mindfulness as the skill that gives you the faculty of voluntarily bringing back a wandering attention over and over again. I think this sounds like a helpful concept especially since my mind wanders at the speed of light and I struggle sometimes to remain focused and zen.
            <p class="blog-text">
              In the first three chapters of his book, Meng constantly reminds the reader that this is not an overnight process - it requires baby steps...literally. Meng uses the example of a baby learning to walk, it might take them months between taking their first step to being able to walk across the room. I always find that things like meditation and exercise fall down my priority list when I have lots going on (which is most of the time) so I like the idea of taking it slow and building on this knowing that I am slowly building the "mind muscles" to be able to be mindful in my daily life.
