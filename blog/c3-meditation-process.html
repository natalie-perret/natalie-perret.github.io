              The "process over product" concept was easy when I was struggling to get the process right, mainly because I was too distracted by my frustrations to worry about perfectionism. However, once I figured out the "process" I became a bit obsessed about my "product". Definitely went down the rabbit hole a few times and had to talk myself back out.

              Meditation has always been somewhere down the bottom of my to do list. It's something that I consider useful towards improved wellbeing especially in a world that never stops, but I've never quite had the time and motivation to prioritise it. 'Search Inside Yourself' uses the analogy between meditation and exercise - the more you exercise, the more you train your muscles and the easier it gets. This makes sense to me and is quite fitting because exercise is also on my to do list and when I do it, I always feel a lot better and the next time is much easier. So I will keep this in mind about meditation.
